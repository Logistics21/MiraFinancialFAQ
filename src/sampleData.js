      If you are older, overweight, smoke or have a medical condition, purchasing \
      life insurance can be harder and more expensive. Mira uses advanced technology \
      and data to help you get life insurance at a better price, and through a faster \
      and easier online process.",

    title: "Why should I get life insurance through Mira?",
    body: "Some websites offer “free quotes”, but what they really do is sell your \
    information to other agents. This never happens at Mira. Our licensed insurance \
    professionals  earn salaries rather than commissions, and will not push you \
    products you don’t need. Also, because Mira is uniquely focused on helping \
    higher risk customers, we can help you get life insurance based on your \
    specific conditions and needs.",

    title: "Does Mira offer better prices?",

    technology and data we can help you get life insurance specifically \
    personalized for your needs as a diabetic. Our customers have saved up \
    to 50% on their policies. We also never charge fees and don’t employ \
    commissioned sales agents.",

    protected millions of families for over a hundred years. The insurance \
    company pays the guaranteed coverage amount to your beneficiaries in case \
